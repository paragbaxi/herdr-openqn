# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Wizards are safe.** Claude Code's several-question dialog (a tab bar over the questions)
  used to show as one question, and the panel's fallback Enter answered the next question with
  whatever was highlighted. The card now says "N questions in one dialog: … Answer them in the
  terminal." with no options; the panel reads the screen before every key press, also on
  Retry and `asks.accept`, and presses nothing while the bar is up. A dialog declined in the
  terminal is "Declined in terminal", not delivered. Late pickups are logged like any answer.
  A declined dialog's remnants and login or API errors no longer become cards; box borders
  come off dialog lines (as in PR #8). Tests cover all of it against captured screens.
- **Codex.** A Codex turn that ends in a plain-text question becomes a card and is answered
  with a message, like Claude Code's. A space can mix both; each terminal is read in the
  format of the program in it.
- **Classifier without Claude.** Plain-text questions are read by the Claude Code CLI when
  installed, else by the Codex CLI (`codex exec`, newest copy found); `classifier` in
  `asks.json` forces one. With neither, a notice asks for an issue.
- **Dropped pastes.** Codex sometimes drops a sent answer; the panel notices (hc reports no
  turn started) and presses Enter or resends once. Failed cards resolve themselves: delivered
  when the agent moves on, `Agent closed` when it is gone, `Not delivered` after ten minutes.
  `Open terminal` on a closed agent no longer throws a toast.
- **Clear** on the Answered list forgets every finished card in the shown scope.
- **Tests.** The screen and report parsers moved to `mods/tabs-asks/parse.js` (no Herdr
  import) and run under `node --test` against real captured screens, on every PR through
  GitHub Actions. `scripts/check-mods.sh` loads the mods in the app's checker;
  `scripts/e2e.py` is the live release check (Claude alone, Codex alone, both).
- **Decisions log out of the repo** (issue #2). The default is now one file per space,
  `~/.config/herdr-app/decisions/<space>.md`; each line also names the agent's folder.
  `log` takes `{space}` and `{repo}`; `"docs/decisions.md"` restores the old in-repo file.

## 0.3.0 · 2026-11-10

- **Flat spaces list** (PR #3, thanks paragbaxi). `group_spaces_by_machine: false` in
  `asks.json` drops the header per machine once a second machine is added and shows one list.
  The default keeps the headers.
- **Installer** recognises its own older copy of the spaces mod after the repo rename, instead
  of refusing to update it.
- **No more false "failed" cards** (issue #1). After an answer, the panel polls the agent for up
  to 8 s and counts the terminal's turn moving on as delivered, so a fast agent that already
  replied, or a paste hc held until the terminal went quiet, no longer fails the card. Retry
  never sends an answer twice: a card whose agent moved on becomes "Picked up late", and the
  engine heals such cards on its own.
- **Faster.** The classifier starts the Claude CLI without your MCP servers and settings, which
  cuts a plain-text question's detection from ~6 s to ~3 s; the engine ticks every second.
- **Log path** (issue #2). `log` accepts `~/…`; the README says the default lands in the
  agent's repo and how to move it.

## 0.2.2 · 2026-11-10

- **Preview, take two.** The product shot now shows the options on every card: the plain-text
  question's choices, the approval's Yes / Yes, and accept edits / No, and the payment menu.

## 0.2.1 · 2026-11-10

- **New preview.** A product shot of the panel with all three card kinds (a plain-text
  question, an approval, an option menu) and the Asks button; it is the README header and the
  gallery picture.

## 0.2.0 · 2026-11-09

- **Named Asks.** Button, panel, README, recipe and gallery entry all say Asks. The default
  tab-bar label is `Asks`; a `label` in `asks.json` still wins.
- **Shared as a layout.** `layouts/asks.json` is Herdr's main layout with the tab bar and
  spaces list pointed at the clones and the panel added, so the gallery's own install flow
  works. `install.mjs` stays for people who keep their own layout.
- **Plain-text questions.** A finished turn that ends by asking you something becomes a card
  (`trailing_questions`, on by default). Text typed into the prompt box but not sent no longer
  hides the agent's message.
- **Several questions at once.** One card lists them; click a question to unfold the options
  the agent gave for it, draft an answer per question, and send them together as one message.
- **Count per space.** The spaces list shows a red pill with the number of asks waiting in each
  space (`spaces-asks`).
- `tabs-asks.recheck` re-reads every agent's current turn after a rule change.
- Fixed a panel re-render failure that froze it on its last good frame.

## 0.1.0 · 2026-11-07

- First build: cards for Claude Code permission dialogs and option menus, answered from the
  panel with a key press or typed text; `Answered` list; one line per answer in
  `docs/decisions.md`; `All` scope; `asks.accept`; installer with `--uninstall`.
